# aggregators Specification

## Purpose

The behavioral contract of an aggregator account in recompose. An aggregator is one key that reaches many models through a hosted catalog, so it connects exactly as a key and claims no single host. This contract states what the catalog offers, what connecting asks, how the row reads, and why no check stands on it. A models probe answers about a catalog the vendor serves to anyone, never about the key.

## Requirements

### Requirement: OpenRouter connects as an aggregator key

The Aggregators catalog MUST offer OpenRouter as a connectable entry. The entries that lack a contract MUST stand inert under a Soon badge rather than hidden: Together AI, Fireworks AI, Groq, DeepInfra, Cerebras, and a Custom aggregator escape hatch. A picked OpenRouter MUST ask for a name and a key in the anatomy the API Keys destination ships, and the stored account MUST take the `aggregator` kind.

#### Scenario: a person connects an OpenRouter key

- When a person picks OpenRouter in the catalog the Aggregators surface opened
- Then the form asks for a name and a key, and nothing more
- And the connected account lists under the Aggregators surface

### Requirement: An aggregator row claims no single host and offers no check

An aggregator row MUST read in the two-line key anatomy: the product title, then the name beside the masked tail. The row MUST NOT offer a Verify act. A models probe answers about a catalog the vendor serves to anyone, never about the key. The credential-scoped endpoint's spend answer found its surface. The usage screen reads OpenRouter credits as a stamped balance, and the row carries a usage summary that deep-links into it.

#### Scenario: a connected aggregator reads as a key without a check

- When the surface lists a connected OpenRouter account
- Then the row reads the product over the name and the mask
- And no Verify act stands anywhere on or behind the row

#### Scenario: the credits answer reads on the usage screen

- Given a connected OpenRouter account that has served requests
- When the person follows the row's usage summary
- Then the usage screen opens scoped to the account
- And the credits card prints the balance beside the instant of the reading
