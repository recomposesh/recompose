# engine Specification

## Purpose

The behavioral contract of the process that answers for a gateway. It covers where a gateway listens and which callers its listener answers at all. It also covers what a request gets back before any provider connects, and how starting or stopping one gateway leaves every other one alone.

## Requirements

### Requirement: A gateway owns its listener and its port

Each gateway MUST answer on its own port rather than sharing one with its siblings. It MUST answer at `http://<bind address>:<port>`, the origin a person pastes into a client without adding a path. Under the default bind the app prints `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`. A wildcard bind of `0.0.0.0` accepts on every interface but routes nowhere, so the app MUST still print the loopback origin. Any other stored address prints as written. A stored bind address never carries a colon, so an IPv6 literal never stands as one.

Every listener MUST bind the one bind address the settings document holds, and that address MUST default to loopback (`127.0.0.1`). recompose fronts paid accounts, so serving the network is a choice a person makes rather than a default. While the bind address stands at its loopback default, the listener MUST refuse a request whose Host header names anything but a loopback address. A request carrying an `Origin` header MUST refuse with a 403 whatever the bind address. No web page reaches a gateway that way, even after a person widens the bind to the network. Two gateways MUST NOT hold the same port.

#### Scenario: a person starts one gateway

- When a person starts a gateway
- Then a listener answers on that gateway's port on the stored bind address
- And no other gateway's state changes

#### Scenario: a browser page calls a gateway on a widened bind

- Given a gateway serving on a bind address that reaches the network
- When a request arrives carrying an `Origin` header
- Then the listener answers 403 with a typed refusal
- And the request reaches no virtual model and no provider

#### Scenario: two gateways run at once

- When two gateways run
- Then each answers on its own port
- And a request to one never reaches the other

### Requirement: A gateway serves at the root of its own address

A gateway MUST answer at the root of its address rather than under a name-shaped path segment. The address a person copies MUST work as the base URL of a client without an added path.

#### Scenario: a client points at a gateway

- When a client sets its base URL to a running gateway's address
- Then the request the client sends reaches that gateway

### Requirement: The health path answers for real

Each gateway MUST answer a health path with a real response rather than a placeholder, because the health path proves the listener answers before any provider exists.

#### Scenario: a person checks a gateway's health

- When a request arrives at a running gateway's health path
- Then the engine answers with a success carrying that gateway's name

### Requirement: A model request answers with a typed refusal

While a gateway carries no virtual model, a model request against it MUST answer with a typed refusal that names the missing model. Failing at the transport or returning an empty body MUST NOT happen. The refusal MUST carry a shape a client can read.

#### Scenario: a model request reaches a gateway with no model

- When a model request arrives for a running gateway carrying no virtual model
- Then the engine answers with a typed refusal
- And the refusal names the gateway and states that it holds no model

### Requirement: A taken port fails one gateway alone

A gateway whose port another process already holds MUST fail to start, and the report MUST name the port. That failure MUST leave every other gateway untouched, and a second start attempt after the port frees MUST succeed.

#### Scenario: another process holds the port

- When a person starts a gateway whose port another process holds
- Then that gateway reports that it failed to start
- And the report names the port
- And every other running gateway keeps serving

#### Scenario: a person retries after the port frees

- When the port frees and a person starts the gateway again
- Then the gateway serves

### Requirement: The engine reports each gateway's state

The engine MUST report per-gateway running and stopped state to the main process, and the main process MUST carry that state to the screen. The screen MUST drive start and stop for one gateway at a time.

#### Scenario: a person stops one gateway of two

- When a person stops one of two running gateways
- Then that gateway stops answering
- And the app shows it as stopped
- And the other gateway keeps serving

#### Scenario: a gateway arrives while its siblings run

- When a person saves a new gateway while other gateways run
- Then the new gateway starts serving on its own port
- And no running gateway restarts

### Requirement: A gateway that requires a key answers only the caller carrying it

While a gateway requires an API key, its listener MUST refuse every request that arrives without that
key. The refusal MUST arrive before the request reaches a virtual model, a provider, or the traffic
ledger. The listener MUST accept the key in any of the four fields its dialects use. Those fields are
the `Authorization` header, with or without a `Bearer` prefix, the `x-api-key` header, the
`x-goog-api-key` header, and the `key` query parameter. A request presenting more than one candidate
MUST pass when any single candidate matches. The comparison MUST take the same time whatever the
number of leading characters that match.

A gateway that requires no key MUST answer exactly as it answers today. That covers a gateway holding
no key at all and a gateway holding one it no longer requires, and the listener MUST NOT tell the two
apart.

#### Scenario: a request arrives without a key

- When a gateway requires an API key and a request arrives carrying none
- Then the listener answers 401 with a typed refusal naming the gateway
- And the answer carries a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge
- And the request reaches no virtual model and no provider

#### Scenario: a request carries the wrong key

- When a gateway requires an API key and a request arrives carrying a different value
- Then the listener answers 401 with a typed refusal

#### Scenario: a client carries the key in its own dialect's field

- When a gateway requires an API key
- And a request presents it in the `Authorization` header, the `x-api-key` header, the
  `x-goog-api-key` header, or the `key` query parameter
- Then the listener serves the request

#### Scenario: a client fills one field with a placeholder and another with the key

- When a gateway requires an API key
- And a request presents a value that misses in one accepted field and the key in another
- Then the listener serves the request

#### Scenario: a gateway requires no key

- When a gateway requires no API key and a request arrives carrying none
- Then the listener serves the request

#### Scenario: a gateway holds a key it no longer requires

- When a gateway holds an API key with its requirement off
- And a request arrives carrying no key
- Then the listener serves the request

### Requirement: The health paths answer without a key

Each gateway MUST answer its health paths whether it requires an API key or not, because a health path
that needs a credential can't prove the listener answers. Every other path the gateway serves MUST
sit behind the key, the management paths and the WebSocket paths included.

#### Scenario: a health check reaches a gateway requiring a key

- When a gateway requires an API key and a request arrives at a health path carrying no key
- Then the listener answers with the success it gives a gateway requiring none

#### Scenario: a client asks a management path without a key

- When a gateway requires an API key and a request arrives at a management path carrying no key
- Then the listener answers 401 with a typed refusal
