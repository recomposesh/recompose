# dialect-translation Specification

## Purpose

The dialect-translation library makes the engine a two-way translator between five dialects: Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, Gemini, and Interactions. It folds every dialect through a neutral hub with a shape of its own, so a request, a response, and an event stream each cross whole between any pair. Every field meets one of three fates: carried, mapped, or refused typed. No field drops without a trace. The library holds no network or process work, so a later gateway consumes it to serve one dialect from a target that speaks another.

## Requirements

### Requirement: A request translates whole, and no field drops without a trace

The library MUST translate an Anthropic Messages request into an OpenAI Chat Completions request and back. The translation carries the system prompt, the content blocks, the tool definitions, the tool choice, and the images. Every field on the source MUST meet one of three fates the translation names: carried as is, mapped to the other dialect's shape, or refused typed. A field the translation can't carry MUST never vanish without a trace. A tool schema of bare object type MUST normalize to the shape providers requiring properties accept.

#### Scenario: a tool-calling request crosses to the other dialect

- Given an Anthropic request carrying a system prompt, tool definitions, and a tool choice
- When the library translates it for an OpenAI target
- Then the tools, the choice, and the system prompt stand in the OpenAI shape
- And nothing the source carried has vanished without a named fate

#### Scenario: a bare object schema normalizes

- Given a tool whose input schema is a bare object type with no properties
- When the request translates to the OpenAI shape
- Then the schema carries an explicit empty properties object

### Requirement: A response translates whole, including the stops

The library MUST translate a response between the dialects, carrying the text, the tool calls, the stop reason, and the usage counts. The stop reason MUST map to the other dialect's vocabulary, and an unmappable reason MUST refuse typed rather than default.

#### Scenario: a tool-call answer crosses back

- Given an OpenAI response answering with a tool call and usage counts
- When the library translates it to the Anthropic shape
- Then the tool call, the stop reason, and the usage stand in the Anthropic shape

### Requirement: The stream translates event for event

The library MUST translate a streaming answer between the dialects as it arrives. OpenAI chat chunks and Anthropic message events map to one another, tool-call streaming included, and the translated stream MUST end the way the source ended. A tool-call block start MUST carry its tool's name, because a client acting on the stream breaks on a nameless block.

#### Scenario: a streamed tool call keeps its name

- Given an OpenAI stream whose chunks assemble a tool call
- When the library translates the stream to Anthropic events
- Then the tool call's block start carries the tool's name
- And the events end the way the source stream ended

#### Scenario: a mid-stream failure crosses as a failure

- Given a source stream that ends in the dialect's error shape
- When the library translates it
- Then the translated stream ends in the other dialect's error shape
- And no synthetic success stands after the failure

### Requirement: The Responses dialect joins the set

The library MUST translate the OpenAI Responses dialect the same three ways: requests, responses, and the event stream, against each dialect the library holds. Codex speaks only this dialect, so a gateway serving Codex depends on it. The same fates discipline holds: carried, mapped, or refused typed, and never a silent drop. A reasoning item MUST cross to the Anthropic shape: a compatible signature becomes a thinking block, redacted content becomes a redacted thinking block, and a foreign-provider signature drops. The `previous_response_id` conversation handle crosses carried. What a turn resuming server-held state means for routing is the router's question rather than this library's. The engine's `chained_turn` refusal answers it at the router that would spread the turn.

#### Scenario: a Codex request crosses to an Anthropic target

- Given a Responses-dialect request carrying instructions and tool definitions
- When the library translates it to the Anthropic shape
- Then the instructions, the tools, and the input stand in the Anthropic shape
- And nothing the source carried has vanished without a named fate

#### Scenario: a reasoning item crosses to a thinking block

- Given a Responses-dialect request whose history carries a reasoning item with a compatible signature
- When the library translates it to the Anthropic shape
- Then the reasoning stands as a thinking block carrying its signature
- And a foreign-provider signature drops rather than crossing as a fabricated one

#### Scenario: a loose history repairs with a named fate

- Given a history carrying a tool call no tool result ever answered
- When the library translates it to the Anthropic shape
- Then the unanswered call leaves the history
- And the translation names the repair as that call's fate

### Requirement: The Gemini and Interactions dialects join the set

The library MUST translate the Gemini dialect and the Interactions dialect the same three ways: requests, responses, and the event stream, against each dialect the library holds. A native Gemini client asks in the Gemini shape, and Antigravity traffic rides the Interactions shape, so a gateway serving either depends on them. The same fates discipline holds: carried, mapped, or refused typed, and never a silent drop.

#### Scenario: a Gemini request crosses to an Anthropic target

- Given a Gemini-dialect request carrying a system instruction and function declarations
- When the library translates it to the Anthropic shape
- Then the instruction, the tools, and the contents stand in the Anthropic shape
- And nothing the source carried has vanished without a named fate

#### Scenario: an Interactions stream crosses event for event

- Given a source stream in another dialect answering an Interactions-dialect request
- When the library translates the stream to Interactions events
- Then the content and the tool calls stand as Interactions events
- And the events end the way the source stream ended
