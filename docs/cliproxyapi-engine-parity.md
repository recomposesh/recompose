# CLIProxyAPI engine parity

This document is the audit ledger for the CLIProxyAPI engine port. It records evidence, not an
assumption that similarly named code is equivalent.

## Authority and scope

- Upstream: CLIProxyAPI v7.2.125-6-ga6825fe9
- Commit: `a6825fe9`
- Completed parity checkpoint: v7.2.125 / `2e6b1d83`
- Local comparison date: 2026-08-09
- Full inventory audit baseline: v7.2.121 / `8392b180ce3789eba9fd06ebc812b4fc237876e1`
  (2026-08-07), carried forward by the delta section below
- Upstream internal tests at the audit baseline: 329 files, 2,926 `Test*` functions, 16 benchmarks
- Upstream translator tests at the audit baseline: 767 `Test*` functions
- Upstream Interactions translator tests at the audit baseline: 136 `Test*` functions
- Current Recompose engine gate: 544 test files, 4,432 passing tests (2026-08-09)

## Delta v7.2.121 → v7.2.125

Twenty-seven upstream commits landed between the pinned audit baseline and `2e6b1d83`. The
in-scope behavior changes were ported with local behavior tests on 2026-08-09; the remainder of
the window carried no engine-scope behavior change.

## Delta v7.2.125 → `a6825fe9`

Five behavior commits and one merge landed after the completed v7.2.125 checkpoint. The stream-end
finalization already followed from the local hub lifecycle, and the four later changes were ported
with focused behavior tests on 2026-08-09.

| Upstream commit | Upstream change                                                       | Status  | Local disposition                                                                                                   |

| `37411842`      | restore namespaced custom-tool identity through shared handling       | covered | namespace refs retain the child family; response and stream restoration tests preserve custom type and namespace    |
| `5314b29d`      | forward `stream_options.reasoning_summary_delivery=sequential_cutoff` | covered | `codex-stream-options.test.ts` proves unsupported stream options drop while sequential cutoff survives              |

| `a6825fe9`      | normalize forced xAI web-search choice to required `allowed_tools`    | covered | `xai-tools.test.ts` and `xai-request.test.ts` pin the required allowed-tools envelope                               |

The final multiplicity-aware inventory audit is published in
`docs/cliproxyapi-parity/internal-completion-audit.md`: all 2,926 upstream `Test*` functions are
accounted exactly once as 2,536 durable parity rows and 390 approved product-boundary exclusions.
No temporary-only or unaccounted rows remain.

`covered` means a local behavior test proves the externally observable contract. `N/A` is reserved
for implementation details that cannot affect Recompose behavior. `open` means completion is not
yet proved. A passing full suite does not convert an `open` row into `covered`.

## Deliberate exclusions

These are product-boundary exclusions, not hidden parity claims:

- router runtime, until the router feature begins; see ADR 0081;
- CLIProxy Home, CLI, and TUI;
- Redis/PostgreSQL distributed coordination;
- plugin host, plugin store, plugin lifecycle, and plugin hook parity for this phase;
- raw management config and auth-file APIs;
- provider OAuth flows for account contracts Recompose does not expose;
- Go allocation, backing-array reuse, and byte-slice identity assertions.

Provider inference, auth behavior used by Recompose accounts, management behavior exposed by the
desktop engine, watchers, media, realtime, logging, metrics, and error semantics remain in scope.

## Non-translator audit queue

The upstream package inventory below prevents translator completion from being mistaken for engine
completion. Counts are `Test*` functions at the pinned commit; each in-scope or mixed package still
needs row-level classification.

## Current audit frontier

The exact 767-row translator completion reconciliation is published in
`docs/cliproxyapi-parity/translator-completion.md`. Its seven source-family supplements under the
same directory provide every row not already present in the slice tables below: 752 covered and 15
architecture-specific N/A rows, with zero gaps.

All 136 Interactions translator tests are classified. Another 81 Claude↔OpenAI and 7
Antigravity↔Responses translator tests are classified. Four same-dialect OpenAI Chat tests are
classified. Eight OpenAI↔Gemini, 10 Gemini↔Claude, 13 Claude↔Gemini, 13 Codex↔Gemini, 52 Codex↔Claude, 49 Codex↔Chat, 16 Codex↔Responses, 85 Gemini↔Responses, 21 Gemini↔Chat, 21 Antigravity↔Chat, 28 OpenAI↔Claude, 30 Antigravity↔Gemini, 136 Antigravity↔Claude, 36 Responses↔Chat, 15 shared translator tests, and six same-dialect Gemini tests are classified. The remaining 0 translator tests are unclassified. Non-translator engine families still require row-level classification and implementation.

Every discovered behavior gap must be implemented before its row changes to `covered`. Every N/A
row must state the architectural reason, as the allocation-only row above does.
