# `internal/config` final parity reconciliation

Scope: all 49 upstream `Test*` functions under
`/private/tmp/cliproxyapi-reference/internal/config`, reconciled against the current Recompose
contracts, engine, provider transports, and explicit architecture exclusions.

## Final accounting

- **Covered: 22**
- **N/A: 27**
- **Gap: 0**
- **Rows accounted for: 49/49 exactly once**

Recompose persists strict typed account and gateway documents rather than loading CLIProxy's
monolithic YAML/JSON configuration. Raw parser, clone, plugin, router-weight, Home, and fixture-wire
contracts therefore remain N/A. Runtime/provider semantics are covered where Recompose owns an
equivalent surface.

Codex Live media relay is also N/A. It is a separate `/v1/realtime/calls` WebRTC/SDP transport with
ICE servers, UDP candidate ports, and in-process media sessions. Recompose implements OpenAI
Responses HTTP/SSE and Responses WebSocket, not this WebRTC relay. Official OpenAI Realtime guidance
likewise distinguishes WebRTC media negotiation from WebSocket event transport; adding relay-only
configuration without the corresponding transport would create a dead contract.

## Implemented credential policy surface

- `packages/contracts/src/credential-policy.ts` defines strict, partial persisted policy schemas.
- `packages/contracts/src/accounts.ts` permits an optional credential policy on subscription accounts.
- `packages/engine/src/subscription/credential-policy-defaults.ts` applies defaults only to missing fields.
- `packages/engine/src/subscription/credential-runtime-policy.ts` validates in-flight storage/timing,
  concurrency lifecycle/limiter bounds, overflow safety, and provides the per-credential limiter.
- `packages/engine/src/subscription/credential-runtime-policy-parity.test.ts` contains all 11 assigned
  exact-named parity tests.

## Final scope conclusion

Every runtime/provider seam applicable to Recompose is covered. The remaining N/A rows are tied to
surfaces Recompose intentionally does not implement: CLIProxy raw config management, plugins,
router weights, Home, fixture-wire conformance, and Codex Live WebRTC/media relay. No compatibility
shim or inert media-relay configuration is warranted for the implemented Responses WebSocket path.
