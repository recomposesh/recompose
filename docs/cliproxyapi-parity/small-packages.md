# Small internal packages final reconciliation

Scope: all `Test*` functions in the remaining non-plugin small packages requested from the upstream
reference:

- `internal/httpwire` — 4
- `internal/httpfetch` — 3
- `internal/clienterror` — 3
- `internal/safemode` — 3
- `internal/htmlsanitize` — 2
- `internal/credentialweight` — 1
- `internal/misc` — 8
- `internal/managementasset` — 1

Model configuration was already finalized and is excluded. Plugin, router-weight, Home/raw-config,
and management control-panel assets remain architecture N/A.

## Final accounting

- **Covered: 12**
- **N/A: 12**

| --: | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1 | `httpwire`         | `TestOrderedRequestConnReordersKeepAliveRequestsWithoutChangingBodies` | Covered | `subscription/claude-request.test.ts` pins the first-party ordered header tuples and body; `subscription/provider-transport.test.ts` verifies those ordered tuples and unchanged body reach the native `node-wreq` transport.                           |
|   2 | `httpwire`         | `TestOrderedRequestConnPreservesChunkedBodyAndReordersNextRequest`     | N/A     | Recompose sends buffered provider request bodies and delegates HTTP/1.1 connection framing to `node-wreq`; it has no custom connection wrapper or chunked outbound upload state. This refines the earlier ledger's broader “covered” classification.    |
|   3 | `httpwire`         | `TestOrderedRequestConnReportsPartialBodyWrite`                        | N/A     | Partial socket-write accounting belongs to the upstream custom `net.Conn` wrapper; Recompose delegates it to `node-wreq`.                                                                                                                               |
|   4 | `httpwire`         | `TestOrderedRequestConnTracksOnlyWrittenChunkBytesAfterPartialError`   | N/A     | Same excluded custom connection/chunk tracker; no Recompose state depends on partial written byte counts.                                                                                                                                               |
|   5 | `httpfetch`        | `TestGetBytesReturnsBodyAndSendsHeaders`                               | Covered | `subscription/antigravity-version.test.ts` verifies updater headers and manifest response parsing.                                                                                                                                                      |

|   7 | `httpfetch`        | `TestGetBytesEnforcesMaxSize`                                          | Covered | Newly exact-named local test in `subscription/antigravity-version.test.ts`; the production manifest reader now enforces the upstream 4 KiB streaming bound before decoding.                                                                             |
|   8 | `clienterror`      | `TestIsRequestFaultStructuredIdentifiers`                              | N/A     | The classifier exists to choose credential rotation/cooldown after request-shaped failures. Recompose resolves one explicit account and does not perform hidden router selection. Provider errors still pass through with their structured identifiers. |
|   9 | `clienterror`      | `TestIsRequestFault`                                                   | N/A     | Status/message request-fault classification is likewise part of the deferred router/account-selection policy, not response normalization.                                                                                                               |
|  10 | `safemode`         | `TestExampleAPIKeysDetectsOnlyTemplateValues`                          | N/A     | CLIProxy raw-config template-key safe mode; Recompose stores strict typed accounts and never serves this raw-config gate.                                                                                                                               |

## Implemented residual

The only genuine in-scope residual was bounded Antigravity manifest fetching.

`packages/engine/src/subscription/antigravity-version.ts` now reads the manifest stream incrementally
and cancels/rejects once it exceeds 4,096 bytes. It does not first buffer an unbounded response. The
new exact-named `TestGetBytesEnforcesMaxSize` regression test verifies the production fetch path.

No router weight, management asset, safe-mode HTML, raw config, Home, plugin, or ledger code was
added.

## Verification

- Exact upstream packages: **8 packages passed, 24 tests accounted for**.
- Focused local suite: **5 files passed, 61 tests passed**.
- Full engine suite: **306 files passed, 2,171 tests passed**.
- Full engine TypeScript check: passed.
- Full engine formatting: passed across **693 files**.
- Touched-file Oxlint and `git diff --check`: passed.
- Full engine Oxlint currently has one unrelated shared-worktree failure in
  `packages/engine/src/provider/summary-policy-parity.test.ts`: a 64-line callback exceeds the
  50-line function limit. That file was not edited by this reconciliation.
