Feature: Creating a gateway

  Background:
    Given the app is on the gateways screen

  Scenario: A fresh install invites the first gateway
    Then the screen invites "Create your first gateway"
    And the sidebar lists no gateway

  Scenario: The call to action opens the creation sheet
    When the maintainer chooses "Create gateway"
    Then the "Create a gateway" sheet opens
    And the name field holds focus

  Scenario: A later gateway starts from the sidebar
    Given a gateway named "codex" exists
    When the maintainer asks for a new gateway from the sidebar
    Then the "Create a gateway" sheet opens

  Scenario: The keyboard reaches the creation sheet
    When the maintainer presses the shortcut for a new gateway
    Then the "Create a gateway" sheet opens

  Scenario Outline: A stored gateway takes the slug its name derives
    When the maintainer creates the gateway "<name>", leaving the port alone
    Then the stored gateway carries the name "<name>", the slug "<slug>", and the offered port

    Examples:
      | name       | slug       |
      | Codex      | codex      |
      | My Gateway | my-gateway |
      | Kapı       | kapi       |
      | 网关       | gateway    |

  Scenario: A typed port beats the offered one
    When the maintainer creates the gateway "codex" on a free port they typed themselves
    Then the stored gateway "codex" carries the typed port

  Scenario: A gateway stores, loads, and lists before its first model
    Given a gateway named "codex" exists
    When the app restarts
    Then the sidebar lists "codex"
