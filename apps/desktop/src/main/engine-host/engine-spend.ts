/**
 * Answers one child request to spend the target seated at a named route node.
 *
 * @summary Every request draws an answer, including the ones nothing can be granted for, because a
 * child left waiting holds an open turn. One request walking a ladder asks once per attempt and
 * each ask names its own seat, so a refusal answers that seat alone. The credential a resolved
 * grant carries lives in this call's scope and in the message it posts, so nothing longer-lived
 * ever holds it.
 *
 * A port that refuses the message is written down rather than left to carry out, because an
 * unhandled rejection takes the whole main process down with it.
