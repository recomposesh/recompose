# recompose: brainstorm decision journal

_Living notes: updated throughout brainstorming. Translated to English and reconciled 2026-07-21. Entries marked **SUPERSEDED** were overridden by later locked decisions. The design system (claude.ai/design project "recompose-design-system," `design-system/library/`) is the source of truth. The current consolidated spec is `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-recompose-design.md`._

## Project summary

An open-source, local (desktop), offline-first **AI gateway composer**. The user connects AI accounts/providers, creates virtual models on a node-based canvas and wires them to providers. Clients (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor…) see only the virtual models. Failover/round-robin routing runs between the two.

## Settled decisions (from conversation)

- **Purpose:** not a gateway → orchestration/composition. "Wire up your own AI network."
- **License/intent:** open source, no commercial intent. Name: ~~`rewire` (fine as a codename)~~ → **renamed `recompose` (recompose.sh), 2026-07-21.**
- **Form:** desktop app, offline-first, credentials stay local.
- **Core UI thesis:** node-based visual canvas (Intercom Series-like): the user pulls the wires.
- **Abstraction:** virtual/custom model → provider mapping. Each gateway is its own set.
- **Routing:** failover + round-robin (+ possibly cost/policy later).
- **Protocol translation:** Anthropic ↔ OpenAI (both directions). **Later locked (2026-07-21): every gateway always serves both dialects on one base URL. Paths disambiguate (`/v1/messages` vs `/v1/chat/completions`). No protocol subpaths, no per-gateway protocol type.**
- **Provider kinds:** official OAuth (Claude/Codex subscriptions, confirmed working), OpenAI-compatible & Anthropic-compatible (URL+key+header), local (Ollama/LM Studio/vLLM) in the future.

## Settled (brainstorm)

- **Primary scenario:** (D) community tool: broad audience from day one, many providers, polished UI. For the community more than for oneself. → UX + cross-platform quality first.

- **Runtime/stack (CURRENT: pivoted to Electron):** **shell: Electron 30+**. ~~**Bun** = backend/sidecar (gateway engine + protocol translation)~~ **SUPERSEDED (2026-07-21): Bun removed entirely.** The gateway engine runs on Electron's bundled Node inside a **`utilityProcess`** (crash isolation, UI thread stays clean): no separate binary to compile/sign/notarize per platform, no sidecar lifecycle management, single electron-builder chain (incl. `electron-liquid-glass` native rebuild). Node's `http` + Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming is more than enough for local proxy traffic at low Requests Per Second (RPS). The engine stays an **isolated pure-TS package** (`packages/engine`, zero `electron` imports) so a future headless/CLI mode remains possible. Tooling: **pnpm workspaces + Turborepo**, single lockfile, vitest. **Scaffolding (2026-07-21): electron-vite** (`create @quick-start/electron`), the 2026 de-facto standard (main/preload/renderer separation, Hot Module Replacement (HMR) incl. main process, packages with electron-builder under the hood, which the `electron-liquid-glass` native-rebuild chain needs anyway). Electron Forge and webpack-era boilerplates eliminated. Scaffold `apps/desktop` with it, then fold into the pnpm workspace. Frontend web (React/Svelte TBD). **Why the pivot to Electron:** true native Liquid Glass (Meridius-Labs/electron-liquid-glass, `NSGlassEffectView`) needs `BrowserWindow.getNativeWindowHandle()` → Electron-specific, doesn't work with Electrobun's Bun+Zig webview. It was already the documented fallback. Trade-off: 80–150 MB bundle (acceptable for an OSS pro tool). ~~Electrobun~~ eliminated.

- **Build order:** **UI-first.** The team designs and builds the app's visuals/UX end-to-end first, then wires in the backend afterward. The backend adapts from existing OSS (cliproxyapi / opencodex / ccproxy): nothing new to prove there.
- **Focus of this brainstorm:** UI/UX design (screens, canvas, flows, design language).

- **Information architecture:** (B) multi-screen + **canvas per gateway.** Left nav: Gateways / Providers(Accounts) / Logs / Settings. Entering a gateway opens that gateway's own canvas (virtual models ↔ providers wired). Easy to learn, scales. (A "everything on one canvas" eliminated.) _Later simplified: see "IA (simplified)" below. This later revision dropped the top-level Logs surface._
- **Live flow visualization:** **live traffic animation** on the wires: green dots flowing along the cable as clients use the gateway. Real-time sense of activity. (Signature feature.)

- **App shell:** (A) **single grouped left sidebar (~220px) + main canvas.** n8n/Vapi/Linear style. Sidebar grouped with headers (Gateways / Setup / Observe). Top-tabs and 3-pane eliminated (You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI): revisit 3-pane if account counts explode).
- **Sidebar gateway list:** (Slack-channel pattern, approved). The **GATEWAYS** group reads like a Slack channel list. Click → that gateway's canvas opens (each gateway = a persistent, named context). `+ New gateway`. Ref: ClickUp Channels, Asana Projects colored dots, Coda/Airtable grouped lists.
  - **Row format:** ~~name **+ port** (for example, `my-gateway · :8787`)~~ **SUPERSEDED:** with the single-port + path model the row is `name` + status dot only (leading neutral teal `net` icon, since gateways are never branded). The full address lives in the toolbar pill.
  - **Live status dot (tied to the signature):** in Slack a dot = unread. Here = **live health/traffic** → 🟢 pulse (requests flowing/healthy) · ⚪️ gray (idle) · 🟡 amber (a target rate-limited, failover active) · 🔴 red (stopped/error). Optional trailing request counter (like an unread badge). You can see which gateway is "breathing" without entering its canvas.

- **CRITICAL CHARACTER: DESKTOP app, not web.** Native desktop feel is mandatory: title bar / window controls (macOS traffic lights), native-feel sidebar, menu bar, dense & keyboard-first, NO "browser tab" feel. Reflected in all mockups.
- **Reference language:** node canvas → n8n + Intercom Series. Left nav → Vapi/Linear. Note: those are web references. This project pulls them toward desktop character.

- **Target OS:** **macOS-first character, but every platform.** Full native feel on macOS first (traffic lights top-left, sidebar vibrancy/translucency, SF feel). The architecture supports Win/Linux too. macOS polish is the priority but not macOS-only.

- **Design language:** (A) **native macOS** base: neutral grays, real vibrancy sidebar, systemBlue accent, restrained/clean, "Apple's own dev tool" feel. **SIGNATURE:** direction B's green flowing wire glow lives inside A as the accent (live traffic = green flowing dots). Both native and distinctive. _Later locked concretely as **Mac Native (explorations 08 dark / 09 light, TablePlus flavor)**. This locked direction eliminated the Liquid Glass-heavy variants._

- **Canvas node model (the heart):** chain left→right: **Gateway (endpoint) → Virtual Model → [Router] → Target (Account+Model)**.
  - **Router:** explicit node (Q7-A). Modes: failover / round-robin (+ future cost/latency/weighted). Chainable. A VM can also go straight to a single target (router optional).
  - **Leaf = merged target node (Q-A):** "account · model" as one card, the model as a dropdown inside the card. Picking an account **automatically fills** that account's real models into the dropdown. Different models of the same account get separate cards (flexibility kept, canvas stays clean).
  - **Multiple VMs:** one gateway serves several virtual models. All exit from the single Gateway endpoint node. Clients see these VM names.
  - **Node types:** Gateway, Virtual Model, Router, Target(Account+Model). (Account/Provider definitions live on a separate screen. The canvas references them as targets.)

- **IA (simplified):** only **3 top-level surfaces: Gateways / Providers / Settings.** _(Usage later joined as a System item: the shipped sidebar is Local Gateways / Providers / System: Usage · Settings.)_
  - **Providers** = all connected AI sources (OAuth accounts + API-key endpoints) in one place. NO separate "Accounts" screen.
  - **Everything gateway-specific** (name, path, logs) → **click the Gateway node → its panel opens.** NO separate top-level Logs screen. ~~(logs as a tab in the gateway's own panel)~~ **SUPERSEDED (2026-07-21):** logs aren't an inspector tab either. The inspector is Overview + Connect only. The log stream lives in the **full-width bottom panel** (toolbar toggle), scoped to the current selection.
  - **Node settings:** clicking any node type (VM, Router, Target, Gateway) opens its settings. The behavior stays consistent across node types.
  - Onboarding/Client-export aren't separate top-levels. They live in the flow (gateway panel "Connect a client" / first launch).

- **Node settings panel:** (A) **right inspector/drawer**, macOS-native (Xcode/Keynote/Figma inspector precedent). Not a modal (modals = one-shot tasks/confirmations). Maybe a node-attached popover for light nodes later. Canvas + flowing wires stay visible.

- **Provider hookup flow:** (A) **catalog → right drawer.** Providers list + "+ Add provider" → catalog. Picking a provider opens a **right drawer** (consistent with the inspector decision). Inside, per provider, **Claude Code's OAuth-vs-key fork**: a "Sign in (Fewer steps)" OAuth card + an "API key (More flexible)" form (base URL + key + optional header). Local is URL-only later. Ref: Claude Code "Connect with GitHub," Vercel BYOK. Modal (B) and single-page list (C) eliminated.

- **Router node: mode → visual.** One Router node type. **The user picks the mode, the visual follows.**
  - **failover** → **priority ladder**: targets ordered (1→2→3 badges), traffic always to the topmost healthy one. #1 rate-limits/errors → its wire **dies (dashed+✕)**, the green flow shifts down one (the C failover story). Order changes by dragging.
  - **round-robin** → **equal shares**: a share bar inside the router (Vercel %-distribution), dots flow along each wire in turn. Later **weighted** = draggable 60:30:10% bars. If an account drops, its share redistributes (the bar updates live).
  - The user edits mode and target order/weights **in the right inspector**. The C status language is consistent in both modes. Ref: OpenAI/Typeform/ManyChat fan-out branches, Vercel weighted %, Cloudflare LB.
  - **Multi-mode / nesting (open end #1, CLOSED, A):** every Router is **single-mode** and carries a **mode pill** (`⇄ round-robin` / `↓ failover`) → intent readable at a glance. Combinations (for example, falling back only when a round-robin pool runs dry) come from **chaining routers**: a failover router's `#1` slot feeds a round-robin router (the pool), `#2` feeds the standby target. The two visual languages stay cleanly apart: round-robin wires carry **% pills + slider** ("Distribute evenly," Customer.io Random Cohort Branch), failover carries **numbered slots (#1/#2) + dashed "standby"** (Calendly "routes run in order" + Cal.com "Fallback Route"). Targets **always remain separate "Account·model" cards** (card language + flowing dots on every wire preserved). Eliminated: **B** (nested brackets inside one node, which turned targets into in-node rows and swallowed the animation), **C** (no mode, per-row priority+weight, which hid the intent). Companion: router-modes.html. Ref: OpenAI If/else "Else" branch. A natural consequence of the locked "chainable router" rule.

- **Node & wire live status language:** (C) **wire color/flow + corner badge together: fancy.** The wire carries the signature (flowing green dots, canvas always alive). Color gives at-a-distance status (green=flowing / amber=rate-limit 429 / red=error / gray=idle). The corner badge gives precise close reading (✓ / ⏱ / ✕ / ↻). **Key: it turns failover into a visual story**: the rate-limited/failed account's wire goes **dashed-dead** + red ✕, traffic **shifts** to the standby account (the green dots flow there). Visual proof of the orchestration thesis. The brief **requested "as fancy as possible":** glow, flow animation, failover transition animation, node border pulse. Ref: n8n (border+badge+toast), Zoho (Success/Running/Failure/Aborted legend), Zapier (badge+Success/Error branches), Better Stack/incident.io/OpenAI (status dot+uptime). A (color+glow only) and B (badge only) eliminated.

- **Virtual model creation:** (A + A1 continuation). A VM = the **alias** the client sees. The real model stays hidden. Definition = **name + ≥1 target**, and it's a **draft** until wired (amber `!` badge, "no target"), **live** once connected (green ✓, dots flowing).
  - **Birth (A):** drag from a port → the VM appears with an **inline name** editor (Ditto), confirmed with ↵. Mapping isn't a separate form: it's **visual wiring**.
  - **Continuation (A1):** **immediately after** ↵ the output port enters "connect" mode (pulsing) + a **port-attached picker** opens (Langdock/Attio). Grouped: **Route To Target** (list of connected account·models) / **OR** (⤨ add a Router · + connect a new provider). Searchable. `esc` → leave as draft. The same picker appears on port-drag and ⌘K (consistent). The flow itself closes the "a name isn't enough" gap.
  - **Optional (not required, in the inspector, later):** default temp/max_tokens, system-prompt prepend, header override, rate-limit policy, fallback behavior. Ref: Ditto inline naming, Langdock Swap Node categorized port menu, Attio Next-step, Intercom grouped dropdown.

- **Client hookup / export:** (A base + C accent). Clients are CLI tools (Claude Code/Codex/Cursor), not Python → they connect via env (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`/`OPENAI_BASE_URL`) or a config file. Home: **gateway node panel → "Connect" tab** (+ onboarding ③).
  - **A default:** client tabs → each tab a client-specific **ready snippet + Copy**. The header shows the endpoint URL (copyable) + chips for the **model names** the client will see. Universal, always works. Ref: Vercel/Perplexity/Neon language-tab+copy code blocks. _Shipped in the DS as mini-tabs **Claude Code / OpenAI / cURL** over a single "Base URL · serves both dialects" box. No key appears by default. A token box + `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` line appear only when Settings requires it (see "Local auth," below)._
  - **C accent (the desktop proof):** if recompose **detects a client locally**, that tab shows **"Configure automatically"** → recompose writes the config file (for example, `~/.claude/settings.json`) **for you**, with **Undo**. Manual snippets remain the fallback. _Still planned. Not in DS template v1._
  - **B eliminated** (a single raw URL card is too minimal, leaves novices at "where does this go?") but B's URL+models card survives as A's header.

- **First launch / onboarding:** (A base + B touch). **NO signup** (offline-first, credentials local). Onboarding isn't registration: it guides from an empty app to the **first working chain**: connect a provider → create a gateway → connect a client.
  - On first launch, a **persistent checklist card** over the empty canvas (① Connect a provider ② Create a gateway ③ Connect a client) follows Render/Retool clarity. Each step opens its own **drawer/sheet** (consistent with the inspector decision). Finished steps get ✓.
  - At the "create a gateway" step the card **slides aside**, a **ghost chain** (faint Gateway→VM→Target skeleton) + a **single coach mark** drop onto the canvas → the canvas teaches **port-drag** right there (B, canvas-native, matches the node-creation decision).
  - **Subsequent launches** skip the checklist, straight to the canvas. This decision eliminated a full wizard (C): it steals the desktop soul and the signature canvas from the first moment. Ref: Render empty state, Retool "Get started" card, Vercel connect-provider step (minus their signup).

- **Logs / monitoring:** ~~(A base + B "expand" accent, logs as a drawer tab, expandable into a bottom dock)~~ **SUPERSEDED (2026-07-21):** no top-level Logs page and no inspector Logs tab. The log stream lives **only in the full-width bottom panel** (toolbar toggle), **scoped to the current selection**: "the bottom bar shows the selection's logs." Content stays routing-centric, not generic API logs: which VM → which account·model won, the failover/rate-limit story, tokens/latency/cost. Row: `time · status · VM → target | upstream · account | code | latency`. Filter chips: All/Errors/per-VM. Live tail. The canvas stays above with wires flowing. C (full-screen takeover) had already disappeared. Ref: Stripe Logs, Supabase, Base44, ElevenLabs, Vercel Live tail, WRITER.

- **Gateway lifecycle:** (A+B+C all: full access everywhere). A gateway = a list item **+ a running server**, so the primary action is **start/stop**.
  - **Sidebar (speed):** the status dot is a **one-click start/stop toggle**. Hover `⋯` (right-click same) → Start/Stop · Rename · **Duplicate** · Delete. Rename also **double-click inline** (Coda). ~~Port değiştir~~ (no per-gateway port in the single-port model).
  - **Toolbar (authority):** _originally "drawer Overview header," and the authority home moved to the top toolbar_: start/stop toggle in the left capsule + `⋯` menu (Rename · Duplicate · Delete…) + the danger-zone Delete confirmation.
  - **Destructive actions confirm:** delete modal ("connected clients will lose this endpoint · can't be undone").
  - **Duplicate (valuable for a community tool):** copies the config, appends "-copy" to the name → shareable-template feel. ~~port auto +1~~ **SUPERSEDED:** single port + path-per-gateway. A duplicate gets a new path on the same port.
  - Ref: Coda sidebar `⋯` (Rename/Duplicate/Delete + right-click), Toggl `⋮`, Lemni Edit/Remove. This design's addition = Start/Stop on top (the server difference).

- **Error states:** (A base + B layer). Principle: **NO full-page takeover** (Buffer/Veed/Monarch anti-pattern). Errors live where they happen. Better Stack's "localized status" direction is right.
  - **Taxonomy:** ① node/wire routing (429/500/down) → **the already-locked wire/badge language** (dashed-dead wire + ✕, green flow shifting to failover). ② App-level (port taken, OAuth exhausted, offline, config unwritable) → not owned by one node → banner/toast. ③ Provider/account (auth expired, invalid key, quota) → badge on that row/node + drawer "Reconnect." ④ Catastrophic crash (rare) → the single exception, full-screen fallback accepted.
  - **A backbone (in-place/localized):** every error at its exact node/wire/row, with "why + Retry" beside it. One-to-one with the signature status language. No takeovers.
  - **B accent (banner+toast):** only for app errors not owned by a node: a thin top banner (port taken→"Change port," OAuth→"Reconnect," offline) + inline action. Transient events appear as toasts. The canvas is never blocked.
  - **C eliminated (separate health center):** by the same logic that killed top-level Logs: sidebar live dots + node/wire status already aggregate health, so a separate center is redundant. Ref: Better Stack, Google Meet inline recovery.
  - **Empty states:** solved in onboarding (empty canvas + checklist + ghost chain). Other gaps (no providers → "Connect" Call To Action (CTA), no logs → "waiting for the first request") share the same quiet inline language.

- **Node creation / wiring:** (A + C together). **Primary:** drag from a port → on release a "what should this connect to?" menu (n8n logic, discoverable). **Power user:** ⌘K command palette to search-insert nodes (keyboard-native, Linear/Fey/Raycast language). NO left palette (B): no screen cost, the port-drag menu already presents the types.

- **Local auth & network exposure (LOCKED 2026-07-21: added post-brainstorm, LM Studio model):** this design rejected the contextual-key idea (require a key only when bind equals Local Area Network (LAN)) as too hard to explain. After web research (Ollama's refusal of API keys, plus Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) advisory CVE-2024-28224 on Domain Name System (DNS) rebinding, and LM Studio's flat toggle): ① no API key in the default UI. ② the engine validates Origin/Host headers (DNS-rebinding hardening, spec-only, invisible). ③ one flat always-visible **"Require API token"** switch in Settings › Server, off by default: recompose fronts **paid accounts**, so serving on LAN without a token would be quota theft. ON reveals the token row (`rc-local-…` + Copy + Regenerate) and grows the Connect tab with an `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` line. Spec'd in DS templates (gateway-detail screen 3, settings).

## Design language (style foundation, companion: style-foundations.html)

> **SUPERSEDED as a whole (2026-07-20):** this Liquid Glass-heavy section was the pre-exploration direction. The locked direction is **Mac Native (explorations 08 dark / 09 light, TablePlus-style flat pro tool)**: vibrancy only in the sidebar, flat opaque chrome elsewhere, **full-tint node borders** (not the "3px left spine on monochrome cards" idea below), flow green `#32d74b` (dark) / `#1a9e33` (light) rather than `#7dffb0`. Kept for history:

Reference: Claude / ChatGPT / Codex desktop language (Mobbin web) + **Apple Liquid Glass** (Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2025 / macOS Tahoe 26, and the Mobbin ios collection: Glass, Comet, Tide). Core traits: **Liquid Glass material · monochrome-first · one frugal accent · typography carries hierarchy · native controls · red only for destructive**.

- **MATERIAL = native Liquid Glass (old decision):** not CSS-fake glass. Native `NSGlassEffectView` behind transparent web content (macOS 26+, with `NSVisualEffectView` as the fallback below). Layers: highlight (specular light) · shadow (depth separation) · illumination. Window + sidebar + floating panels (drawer, toolbar, ⌘K palette) = glass. Web backgrounds transparent in those areas so the native glass shows.
- **Surfaces (tone-on-glass logic):** glass material native. On the web side: dark semi-transparent tones for the content layer over glass, opaque card/node `~#212127`, hairline separators/edges `#2a2a30`, and specular edge as a thin light inset. (In claude.ai/design previews, CSS glassmorphism simulates the glass: blur+saturate+inset specular. The real app uses native glass.)
- **Accent + signals:** systemBlue `#0a84ff` **only** for selection/active/primary action + focus rings. **The single live signature = flowing-traffic green `#7dffb0`** (recompose's brand moment, like Claude reserving its color for the logo, but only on live traffic). Amber `#f5a623` = rate-limit/429. Red `#ff453a` = errors/destructive only.
- **Rule:** chrome stays grayscale. Color only when it carries **meaning**. _(This rule survived into Mac Native.)_
- **Typography:** SF / `-apple-system`. Hierarchy via **size+tone**, not color/boxes, with negative letter-spacing on large titles and calm body. Text layers: primary `#f5f5f7` · secondary `#a0a0a8` · tertiary `#6c6c73`.
- **Controls:** pill toggle (on=systemBlue), segmented control, dropdown chevron, rounded button `r=8`, and thin monochrome SF-Symbols icon language. Cards/drawers `r=10–12`, airy padding.
- **Node language (old decision, SUPERSEDED):** ~~all nodes the same monochrome card (`#212127`); the type color (Gateway gray · VM blue · Router orange · Target purple) lives only as a thin 3px left spine~~ → the locked direction uses **full-tint node borders** and Gateway = **teal** (this decision eliminated the gray gateway). The only truly live element on the canvas is still the flowing green dots.

## Gap sweep (secondary surfaces)

- [x] Gateway lifecycle (start/stop/rename/duplicate/delete) → A+B+C all (sidebar speed + toolbar authority + confirmation)
- [x] Gateway detail IA + "Overview" tab content → see below
- [x] Canvas crowding → free-drag base + A navigation + B opt-in Tidy + C folding (see below)
- [x] Settings content → B single-column grouped + ⌘, focus (see below)

### Settings screen (see settings.html)

Layout decision: **B: one scrollable grouped page** (NO category rail, escapes the double-sidebar, content is small). macOS grouped-card language (Google Drive/System Settings). Click the "Settings" surface in the main sidebar → opens in the content area. **⌘,** focuses this surface, doesn't open a separate window (preserves the IA lock). **C (separate Preferences window) eliminated.** If content grows, promoting to A (category rail) is easy.
~~Original draft groups (General/Appearance/Advanced/Updates/About)~~ **SUPERSEDED: shipped DS structure (source of truth).**

- **General:** Launch at login · Show in menu bar · Start gateways on launch.
- **Server:** Default port (:8397, single port) · Bind address (Localhost only / LAN) · **Require API token** (+ revealed token row: `rc-local-…` + Copy + Regenerate).
- **Appearance:** Theme (System/Light/Dark) · **Reduce wire motion** (the signature flowing-dot effect, for low-power mode).
- **Data:** Config folder `~/.recompose` + "Reveal in Finder" · Keep request logs (24h/7d/30d) · Telemetry: "None: recompose never phones home" (offline-first, stated explicitly = trust).
  Deferred from the draft: accent-color picker · config export/import · auto update group + "Check now" · request-timeout default.

### Canvas crowding (see canvas-scale.html)

This project's graph stays fixed-layered: Gateway → VM → [Router] → Target. Crowding comes from parallel VM count (1 gateway × N virtual models × M targets stacking vertically).

- **Base = free drag** (n8n-like manual positioning). User decision: automatic layout isn't the backbone.
- **A (always) = standard graph controls:** corner minimap + zoom cluster (⊞ fit · −/+/% · ✋ pan · ↺). Vapi/WRITER standard. Default navigation layer. _(Shipped: zoom cluster bottom-left, minimap bottom-right.)_
- **B (opt-in) = automatic layered layout** only when the user hits **"✨ Tidy"** → nodes snap into Gateway·VM·Target columns. Not continuous/automatic, one click.
- **C = collapsible VM strips:** each VM is a strip: the focused one stays open (targets visible), the rest fold to one line ("fast ▸ 2 targets"). Vertical scale for many VMs. A mini status dot on the folded strip (instead of live wires).
- Plus: the sidebar toggle (⌘\) gives the canvas full width.

### Gateway detail (see gateway-detail-entry.html)

_"If the canvas is already the detail, where does the drawer open?"_

The gap the user caught: clicking a gateway in the sidebar opens its canvas (spatial detail). But where do Overview/Connect trigger? Solution = the **3-column shell**, the merge of two overlapping locks.

- **Left sidebar = PERSISTENT but toggleable** (app shell): GATEWAYS list (Slack-channel + live dot) · PROVIDERS · SYSTEM. It doesn't disappear inside a gateway: one-click switching between gateways. **macOS-native toggle** (`sidebar.left` icon at the header's left + `⌘\`): closing it gives the canvas full width (Xcode/Mail/Finder pattern, which also helps canvas crowding).
- **Canvas = the gateway's spatial detail.** **The canvas itself** shows live routing health (flowing green dot wires, round-robin shares, the failover ladder, down = red ✕).
- **Persistent top toolbar** (Mobbin: Squarespace editor's persistent top bar): start/stop capsule · address pill `http://localhost:8397/my-gateway · running` · `⋯` lifecycle menu. **The home of lifecycle** (the "toggle in the drawer header" gap from the A+B+C decision resolved here) + at-a-glance status. NO "‹ Gateways" back arrow: the sidebar already provides that list.
- **Click the Gateway ENDPOINT node → the Overview / Connect inspector** opens: part of the "every node opens its own inspector" rule (no new concept). ~~Logs as a third tab~~ **SUPERSEDED:** logs moved to the bottom panel.
- **Overview content = aggregate NUMBERS** (endpoint status, last-24h request/token/error/p95 KPIs, served-models shares): **A cards** won.
- **Overview option B (routing-health/target list) ELIMINATED** → the canvas already shows it live. Repeating it in the drawer would be a copy.

## Open design questions (filled during brainstorm)

- [x] Node creation / wiring interaction → A port-drag + C ⌘K
- [x] Main screens / surface list → Local Gateways / Providers / System (Usage · Settings). Templates: gateway, onboarding, gateway-detail, settings
- [x] Canvas node types → Gateway / Virtual Model / Router / Target
- [x] Onboarding / first launch → A checklist card + B ghost chain/coach mark (at the gateway step)
- [x] Design language / look & feel → **Mac Native, explorations 08/09 locked** (see the superseded style section)
- [x] Provider/account hookup screen → A catalog→right drawer, OAuth/key fork
- [x] Virtual model creation flow → A inline name + A1 post-↵ auto port-picker (target/router)
- [x] Node/wire live status language → C (wire color/flow + badge + failover story, fancy)
- [x] Expressing routing visually (failover/round-robin) → the user chooses the mode, the visual follows (ladder / shares)
- [x] Logs / monitoring → bottom panel only, selection-scoped (routing-centric, no separate page, no inspector tab)
- [x] Client export flow → A client-tab snippets (+ C auto configure planned, token line only when required)
- [x] Empty states, error states → A in-place/localized + B banner/toast (no takeovers, empty=onboarding)

## Conditional router (2026-08-19)

- **Mode, not a node (A):** conditional joins failover and round-robin as the third mode of the single Router node. The mode pill reads `? conditional`. Chaining stays free. A separate node type (B) eliminated: it would fork the locked "single-mode router + mode pill" rule.
- **How it decides:** one constrained classification call per decision. The judge receives the branch labels, the rules, and the request tail, then answers with one branch label. A broken answer earns one retry, then the else branch. A timeout budget (about 3 seconds) also lands on else. Routing trouble never drops a request.
- **Judge = a real binding:** the judge is an account plus a provider model, resolved with the same custody, cooldown, and health rules as any target. Fast, cheap models judge best, and the inspector says so.
- **Mandatory else:** every conditional router carries a permanent else branch. No match, judge error, judge cooling, and timeout all land there. Ref: OpenAI If/else "Else" branch.
- **Sticky by default:** a conversation keeps the branch it first earned, keyed by a conversation fingerprint. The prompt cache survives, and mid-conversation behavior stays stable. An inspector toggle ("Re-judge every request") opts out. Server-state turns follow the `wouldRotate` precedent and refuse a branch change.
- **V1 rules are natural language only:** each branch = a short label plus a free-text rule. Deterministic conditions (regex, token count, headers) stay out. They belong to a future judge-free rule mode.
- **Canvas language (wire rules, A):** each branch cable carries its rule pill. The chosen branch flows green. Else hangs dashed until it carries traffic. Eliminated: B slot rules (rule rows with their own ports inside a tall card, which swallowed the hexagon) and C prompt panel (bare canvas, all meaning hidden in the inspector).
- **Judge on the canvas (satellite, E):** a small round node with a scale glyph rides above the router on a dotted tie from a shoulder port. The distinct silhouette says advisor, not target. Cooling turns it amber with a timer badge. Eliminated: side cable to a full card (target lookalike), docked badge (hides health), sub-port below (crowds the row), inbound-wire chip (collides with rule pills).
- **Labels:** the branch label is the classification token the judge answers with. A dropped cable births a draft branch, amber until named and ruled. The pill opens the same inline editor as virtual model naming (Ditto). An empty label fills itself from the rule text (Customer.io's derived wire labels, judge flavored).
- **Rule editing:** inspector rows show a one-line preview. The full rule lives in a "Branch rule" sheet: a label field, a routes-to line, a wide textarea, and a destructive "Delete branch." In-panel editors (too cramped) and accordions eliminated.
- **Flow screens:** `recompose.pen` carries the full flow, 0 to 7, in both schemes: fresh switch (judge unbound), rules in the inspector, branch birth, pill rename, rule editor sheet, the judge decides, judged traffic flows, and judge cooling with else catching.
- **Engine landing spots:** `RouterPolicy` grows a `conditional` variant with payload (judge binding, rules, else, timeout). The walk's `ChildPicker` goes async. The judge inherits the cooldown ledger. Router depth stays capped at 4, so chained judges stay bounded.
